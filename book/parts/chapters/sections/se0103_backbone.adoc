While Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a strategic framework, its successful implementation relies heavily on a robust technological foundation.  This foundation consists of two essential components: Product Data Management/Engineering Data Management (PDM/EDM) systems and Computer-Aided Design/Manufacturing/Engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) software. These technologies work in concert to manage data, automate processes, and empower collaboration throughout the product lifecycle.

PDM/EDM systems serve as the central hub for all product-related information, providing a secure repository for storing, organizing, and managing data from various sources. They enable version control, change management, and access control, ensuring data integrity and facilitating collaboration across departments. CAD/CAM/CAE software, on the other hand, provides the tools for creating, analyzing, and manufacturing products, generating the data that flows through the PDM/EDM system.

This section provides a brief introduction to these core technological pillars of PLM, outlining their respective roles, functionalities, and how they interact to support a holistic, data-driven approach to product development.
