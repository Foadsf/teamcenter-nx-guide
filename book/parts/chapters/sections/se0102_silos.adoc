For decades, the traditional approach to product development relied on a linear, departmentalized model. Design, engineering, manufacturing, and other departments often operated in isolation, with limited communication and data sharing. This siloed approach led to inefficiencies, miscommunications, delays, and ultimately, compromised product quality and profitability. 

Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) challenges this outdated model by recognizing the fundamental interconnectedness of all departments involved in the product journey. It emphasizes a collaborative, cross-functional approach, where data flows seamlessly across disciplines, enabling teams to work together in real-time, share insights, and make informed decisions throughout the product lifecycle.

This section explores the collaborative nature of PLM, highlighting how it breaks down departmental barriers, fosters a shared understanding of product goals, and ultimately, empowers companies to develop and deliver exceptional products that meet customer expectations and drive market success.
